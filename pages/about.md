# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a software developer with a background in computer science and information engineering. My 6 years of web developer experience has given me a strong foundation for web development and building complex solutions. And another 8 years to learn how to running my own business, to solve a bunch of problems, and deal with anything. My company suspended during COVID-19, but I am passionate about coding and solving problems through code, and I am excited to work with other amazing programmers!
